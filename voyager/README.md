## ðŸš€ Deploy a Site to production

<details><summary>Prerequisites</summary>
<p>

- Unix
- Git
- PHP
- MySQL
- Composer
- Access to `https://bitbucket.org/pvtl/deploy-script.git`
- Access to the Git repo you're wanting to clone
- The domain name you'll be using for the site, must be live and propagated (i.e. for the script to be able to reach it via a CURL request). To get around this, you could either:
    - Add the domain to the *server's* host file (eg. `127.0.0.1 example.com`)
    - Point another 'disposable' (eg. `justfordeploy.pvtl.io`) domain to it for setup, then once deployed, change the domain name in `deploy.json` and `.env`


</p></details>

<details><summary>What does this do?</summary>

<p>

In the past, deploying a Voyager site typically requires:

1. Finding, downloading, connecting to FTP, uploading, configuring `deploy.php` and the `deploy.json` config
1. Next, through the browser, filling out/submitting deploy.php
1. Next `Stage & deploy`
1. Next, through FTP, create, upload, configure a `.env` (and go to another site to generate WP Secrets custom to this site)
1. Next, through FTP, create, upload, configure a `.htaccess` for password protecting the directory

This script does all of the above with a single command:

- In a single place, provides step-by-step prompts for the required information
- Grabs the `deploy.php` script from Git (placing it on the server)
- Grabs the `deploy.laravel.json` (placing it on the server)
- Automatically (using user input) sets up the deploy script & deploys
- Configures Voyager:
    - Database credentials and URL
    - Generates secrets
- Sorts out file ownership

</p></details>

### Usage

SSH into the destination server and change to the correct user (`sudo su - -s /bin/bash <cPanel username>`)

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pvtl/install-scripts/master/voyager/deploy.sh --output voyager-deploy.sh && bash voyager-deploy.sh && rm voyager-deploy.sh
```
