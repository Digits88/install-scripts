# Project Install Scripts

Setting up a fresh site takes time. Maybe you've got a checklist you meticulously follow each time - eg. download Wordpress from wordpress.org, get my theme and put it in the right place, get plugins x, y and z, add the specific config to the backend... Or, maybe you wing it...

__Wouldn't it be great to run a single command and have the site setup and ready to go, the way you want it each time?__

The following scripts are how we at [Pivotal Agency](https://www.pivotalagency.com.au) like our sites setup by default.

It's ok if you use different config or want different plugins - feel free to fork this repo and make them your own. We hope you'll find benefit in our template.

- [Wordpress](/wordpress)
- Magento2 (coming soon...)
- Voyager (coming soon...)
