## Deploy a Site

### ðŸ¤ž Prerequisites

- Unix
- Git
- PHP
- MySQL
- Composer
- Access to `https://bitbucket.org/pvtl/deploy-script.git`
- Access to the Git repo you're wanting to clone

### ðŸ¤” What does this do?

In the past, deploying a Wordpress site typically requires:

1. Finding, downloading, connecting to FTP, uploading, configuring `deploy.php` and the `deploy.json` config
1. Next, through the browser, filling out/submitting deploy.php
1. Next `Stage & deploy`
1. Next, through FTP, create, upload, configure a `.env` (and go to another site to generate WP Secrets custom to this site)
1. Next, through FTP, create, upload, configure a `.htaccess`

This script does all of the above with a single command:

- In a single place, provides step-by-step prompts for the required information
- Grabs the `deploy.php` script from Git (placing it on the server)
- Grabs the `deploy.wordpress.json` (placing it on the server)
- Automatically (using user input) sets up the deploy script & deploys
- Configures Wordpress:
    - Database credentials and URL
    - Generates WP secrets/keys/salts
    - A default `.htaccess`
- Sorts out file ownership

### ðŸš€ Usage

SSH into the destination server and change to the correct user (`sudo su - -s /bin/bash <cPanel username>`)

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pvtl/install-scripts/feature/deploy-wp/wordpress/deploy.sh --output wordpress-deploy.sh && bash wordpress-deploy.sh && rm wordpress-deploy.sh
```

_It will provide a few basic prompts for everything._
